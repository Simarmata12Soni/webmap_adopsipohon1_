Roseland Cottage,"Woodstock, Connecticut",Architecture,media/roseland-cottage-icon.jpg,"With its distinctive pink exterior, Roseland Cottage was built in 1846 as the summer home of wealthy businessman Henry Bowen, his wife Lucy, and their young family in <a href=""https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/woodstock/"" target=""_blank"">Woodstock, Connecticut</a>. The house is an excellent example of Gothic Revival architecture, which was popular in the mid-1800s and featured elements like steep-pitched roofs, use of pointed arches for doors, windows, and ornamental elements, and decorative cut or pierced wood trim, sometimes referred to as ""gingerbread trim.""<br><br>The five-bedroom, 6,000-square-foot house was designed by English-born architect Joseph C. Wells. The estate also includes landscaped grounds and gardens, an ice house, aviary, carriage barn, and the nation's oldest surviving indoor bowling alley.<br><br>In the 1870s the house and its outbuildings were expanded to accommodate the growing Bowen family and their needs. The larger service areas included a laundry room, butler's pantry, scullery, and additional bedrooms for live-in staff. In the 1880s the Bowens redecorated the home's interior, replacing fireplace tiles, adding stained glass in the parlor windows, and installing new carpets and wall coverings in the latest styles.<br><br>Although Roseland Cottage was primarily a family retreat, Henry Bowen entertained friends and important guests--including four U.S. presidents--there. In 1870 President Ulysses S.

The Frog Bridge,"Willimantic, Connecticut",Architecture,media/frog-bridge-icon.jpg,"This bridge across the Willimantic River might look like any other highway bridge, except for the four giant frogs sitting atop spools of thread at each end. Known officially as the Thread City Crossing, the bridge opened in 2000, replacing an 1857 stone bridge, which is now a pedestrian walkway. The bronze frog sculptures are the work of artist Leo Jensen of Ivoryton, Connecticut, and they commemorate one of the strangest tales from Connecticut's history--""The Great Windham Frog Fight"" or ""Battle of the Frogs.""<br><br>Life on the frontier in mid-18th-century Connecticut was dangerous, and the <a href=""https://connecticuthistory.org/connecticut-in-the-french-and-indian-war/"" target=""_blank"">French and Indian War</a> had just broken out. And so it was that when the residents of the village of <a href=""https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/windham/"" target=""_blank"">Windham</a> heard a dreadful cacophony one night in 1754, they were terrified. Some thought the village was under attack; others thought it was the trumpets of Judgment Day. Brave men ventured out and fired their muskets towards the noise.<br><br>As day broke there was quiet, and soon everything was explained. Hundreds of bullfrog corpses littered the ground near a small pond about a mile east of the village. It seems that a summer drought had caused the frogs to battle to the death over the limited water available.<br><br>In the years that followed, the story became very popular, inspiring various songs and works of art, including the current Frog Bridge.

Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Arch,"Hartford, Connecticut",Architecture,media/soldiers-sailors-arch-icon.jpg,"On September 17, 1886, the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Arch was dedicated in <a href=""https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/hartford/"" target=""_blank"">Hartford</a> to honor the 4,000 Hartford residents who served, and the nearly 400 who died, in the <a href=""https://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/civil-war/"" target=""_blank"">Civil War</a>. Designed by Hartford architect George Keller, the monument was the first permanent triumphal arch erected in the United States. The monument consists of two Romanesque-style towers joined by a Gothic Revival pointed arch and decorative frieze. It is made from <a href=""https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/portland/"" target=""_blank"">Portland</a> (CT) brownstone and cost about $60,000 in city funds to build.<br><br>The monument tells the story of Hartford's role in the Civil War. The life-sized terra cotta frieze depicts scenes of war sculpted by Samuel Kitson on the north side and scenes of peace and victory by sculptor Caspar Buberl on the south side. On the south frieze, Hartford is represented by the figure of a seated woman, below which appears the Latin motto, post nubila phoebus: after clouds, the sun. Midway up the monument, eight-foot-tall statues designed by German-born sculptor Albert Entress represent those from Hartford who served in the Union army: student, farmer, freed slave, carpenter, stone mason, and blacksmith. The newer plaque under the statue of the freed slave honors the 128 African American residents of Hartford who fought for the Union.<br><br>When George Keller died in 1935 at the age of 93, his family had his remains cremated and interred behind a plaque in the interior of the east tower.

Heublein Tower,"Simsbury, Connecticut",Architecture,media/heublein-tower-icon.jpg,"Heublein Tower is actually the fourth tower built on Talcott Mountain. The first one, built by Daniel Wadsworth in 1810, blew down; Wadsworth's second tower burned. In 1867, Matthew Bartlett built a tower that included a tavern and areas for picnicking and dancing. <a href=""https://connecticuthistory.org/people/samuel-clemens-1835-1910/"" target=""_blank"">Mark Twain</a> and his friends frequently made the eight-mile hike from <a href=""https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/hartford/"" target=""_blank"">Hartford</a> to visit it.<br><br>Gilbert F.

While hiking with his fianc√© on Talcott Mountain in 1875, Gilbert promised to build her a castle on the mountain. In 1914, he fulfilled that promise. The six-story, steel-framed, 165-foot tower was designed by Smith & Bassette to withstand 100-mph winds and is anchored into the bedrock. It was used mainly as a summer retreat by the Heubleins. There was a bedroom or living room on each floor, and the top floor--now the observation deck--was a ballroom, used for parties and entertaining. An addition with staff rooms, a larger kitchen, and a dining room was completed in 1929.<br><br>Gilbert Heublein died in 1937, and in 1943 the tower was purchased by the Hartford Times.

West Cornwall Covered Bridge,"West Cornwall, Connecticut",Architecture,media/west-cornwall-bridge-icon.jpg,"Measuring 172 feet long and 15 feet wide, the West Cornwall Covered Bridge carries traffic over the Housatonic River on Connecticut Route 128. One of the last covered bridges in Connecticut, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and has been a symbol of the area's rural heritage for over 150 years.<br><br>Attempts to build bridges at the site go back as far as 1762, but ice storms and floods claimed these early structures. Research has shown that the current bridge was likely built in 1864. It is constructed of red spruce, which is stronger than oak, and held together using treenails--wooden pegs that are wedged into place. It is a lattice truss bridge, a light-weight, efficient, and durable design <a href=""https://connecticuthistory.org/town-patents-the-lattice-truss-bridge-today-in-history/"" target=""_blank"">patented in 1820</a> by Connecticut architect <a href=""https://connecticuthistory.org/people/ithiel-town/"" target=""_blank"">Ithiel Town</a>. The bridge was painted its distinctive red color in 1957.<br><br>Despite its sturdy construction, the bridge has faced numerous challenges, including hurricanes, floods, fire, and heavier vehicle traffic. In 1945, a twenty-ton oil truck fell through the bridge floor. By 1968, the demands on the bridge had changed so much since its original construction that the State of Connecticut considered replacing the one-hundred-year-old structure. A local group committed to saving the bridge stepped in and convinced the state to make renovations instead. In 1973 the Connecticut Department of Transportation inserted a steel support deck that not only saved the bridge but also earned an award from the Federal Highway Administration as an outstanding example of historic preservation.<br><br><a href=""https://connecticuthistory.org/west-cornwall-covered-bridge-an-icon-of-new-england-craftsmanship/"" target=""_blank"">More</a> on the West Cornwall Covered Bridge","West Cornall Covered Bridge, Housatonic River, West Cornwall, CT 06796",41.8715504,-73.3637806,https://goo.gl/maps/tj3NURU11wkDWUe48,media/west-cornwall-bridge.jpg,West Cornwall Covered Bridge,Source: Courtesy of Connecticut Office of Tourism,,media/west-cornwall-bridge2.jpg,West Cornwall Covered Bridge,Shared under Creative Commons,,media/west-cornwall-bridge3.jpg,West Cornwall Covered Bridge,,,,,,,,,,

Minute Man Statue,"Westport, Connecticut",Revolution,media/minute-man-icon.jpg,"The Minute Man Memorial commemorates the final encounter of the 1777 British incursion into Connecticut.

Three days later, however, after the British had raided <a href=""https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/danbury/"" target=""_blank"">Danbury</a> and were pushing back towards their ships, the local farmers and businessmen who made up the militia met them in battle. Though the British successfully fought their back to their ships, the resistance they met along the way helped dissuade them from venturing deep into Connecticut again.<br><br>
Efforts to create a monument commemorating the Patriot resistance to the British in <a href=""https://connecticuthistory.org/towns-page/westport/"" target=""_blank"">Westport</a> started around 1903.
